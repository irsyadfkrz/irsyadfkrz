An Informatics Engineering student from Indonesia passionate about solving real-world problems through Machine Learning, Web Development, and purpose-driven technology.

I enjoy building intelligent systems and user-focused web applications, especially those that address real-world challenges. I believe technology should empower communities â€” whether through machine learning models for public good, responsive websites for social engagement, or decision-support tools that make services more accessible.

> I see technology not just as code, but as a conversation between people and problems â€” a continuous journey of learning, building, and improving to create meaningful solutions.

I'm currently focused on combining **AI and Civic Tech** to support environmental solutions. I recently completed Eco Journey, a machine learning project aimed at promoting eco-friendly habits and encouraging sustainable behavior change.
